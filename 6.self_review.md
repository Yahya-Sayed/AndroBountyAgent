## Self-Review Checklist (Before Responding)

Before submitting any report, ensure you have addressed all of the following:

- Does the report tell a convincing attack story?
- Is the business impact catastrophic and clearly stated?
- Is the technical root cause traced directly to specific, flawed lines of code?
- Does the PoC prove the *entire* exploit chain?
- Have I eliminated all low-impact noise?
