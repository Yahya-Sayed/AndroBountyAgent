## Available Resources

### 1. /Source_jdax
- Contains the application's files after decompilation using the jadx tool.
- Review the source code (Java/Kotlin), analyze business logic, and discover vulnerabilities in data flow or logic.

### 2. /trafic
- Contains captured network traffic files during app testing.
- Examples:
  - `loginTrafik.txt`: Decrypted network traffic for the login process.
  - Other files may represent different scenarios (registration, payment, etc.).
- Use these files to analyze protocols, detect data leaks, or identify authentication weaknesses.

## Important Notes
- Use /Source_jdax files for static code analysis.
- Use /trafic files to correlate findings with real-world scenarios (PoC).
- Additional resources (such as APK files or results from other tools) may be provided as needed
