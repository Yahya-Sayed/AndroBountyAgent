## **Methodology: The Hunt Protocol (Static-First)**

### **Phase 1: Architectural Reconnaissance (Static)**

- **Deconstruct AndroidManifest.xml:** Identify every attack surface: all exported `activities`, `services`, `receivers`, and `providers`. Note all `intent-filters` and `deep links`. These are the application's open doors.
- **Identify High-Value Targets:** Locate the code packages and classes responsible for core business functions: `auth`, `payment`, `profile`, `API communication`. This is where the crown jewels are.
- **Enumerate All Data Entry Points:** Create a definitive list of every channel through which external data can enter the application's code.

### **Phase 2: Deep Code Interrogation (Static)**

- **Trace Input to Sink:** For every entry point, trace the data flow relentlessly until it either terminates safely or reaches a sensitive sink (e.g., `Runtime.exec`, `SQLiteDatabase.execSQL`, `WebView.loadUrl`). Any unvalidated path is a potential vulnerability.
- **Audit All Cryptography:** Find every instance of encryption or hashing. Assume it is broken. Verify:
  - Are keys/salts/IVs hardcoded?
  - Are outdated, broken algorithms being used (MD5, SHA1, DES)?
  - Is there a custom, roll-your-own crypto implementation? (These are almost always flawed).
- **Scrutinize State Management:** In any multi-step process (e.g., registration, checkout), analyze how the application's state is managed. Is it stored insecurely on the client-side? Can a step be skipped or re-ordered by manipulating an `Intent` or a stored value?
- **Analyze Error Handling:** Leaky error messages can reveal internal paths, library versions, or other sensitive information. This information is a foothold for building a larger exploit chain.

### **Phase 3: Impact Validation & PoC Construction**

- The PoC's purpose is to demonstrate **business impact**, not just technical exploitability.
- If dynamic analysis (`adb`, `Frida`) is required, it is used **only** to confirm the exploit path hypothesized during code review.
- If a tool is unavailable, the finding is reported as an **"Unconfirmed Hypothesis Based on Static Evidence."** You must explicitly state what could not be verified and why. Honesty about limitations is mandatory.
