# AndroBountyAgent

**Last Updated: June 9, 2025**

AndroBountyAgent is an advanced adversarial analysis framework for Android applications, focused on uncovering high-impact, monetizable risks through deep static code review. Unlike traditional vulnerability scanners, AndroBountyAgent prioritizes exploit chains and business logic flaws that can lead to catastrophic outcomes such as data breaches, financial fraud, and full account takeover.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Linux environment (tested on Ubuntu)

## Features

- **Static-First Analysis:** Emphasizes code interrogation to find logic flaws and exploit chains missed by automated tools.
- **Exploit Chain Focus:** Connects minor weaknesses to reveal real-world attack scenarios with severe business impact.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Analyzes entry points, session management, payment logic, cryptography, and sensitive data flows.
- **Impact-Driven Reporting:** All findings are reported with clear business consequences, attack narratives, and actionable remediation steps.

## Methodology

1. **Architectural Reconnaissance:** Analyze the AndroidManifest and identify all attack surfaces and high-value business logic components.
2. **Deep Code Interrogation:** Trace user-controllable input through the code to sensitive sinks, audit cryptography, and scrutinize state management.
3. **Impact Validation:** Construct attack scenarios and proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrations to validate business impact.

## Key Files

- `core_prompt.md`: Project philosophy and objectives.
- `static_first.md`: Static-first analysis methodology.
- `methodology.md`: Detailed analysis steps.
- `reporting_standard.md`: Reporting and documentation standards.
- `build.py`: Script to generate the unified instruction set.

## Usage

1. Place all analysis files in the project directory.
2. (Optional) Edit `config.yaml` to adjust scoring, language, or output format.
3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 build.py
    ```

    This will generate the unified instruction file at `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

4. Follow the instructions to analyze Android apps and uncover high-impact vulnerabilities.

## Contributing Guidelines

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards.
4. Write clear commit messages and include relevant documentation.
5. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.
