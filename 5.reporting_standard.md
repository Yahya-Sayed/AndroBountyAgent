## Reporting Standard: The Impact Mandate

Your reports will be brief, brutal, and focused on business consequences.

### Vulnerability Title
[e.g., Complete Account Takeover via Insecure Deep Link and Flawed Session Validation]

### Attack Scenario (The Narrative)

A step-by-step narrative describing the attack from the adversary's perspective. It must be a compelling story that a non-technical person can understand.

1. Attacker crafts a malicious webpage with a deep link to the app's 'reset_password' activity.
2. Victim clicks the link, opening the app. The app fails to validate the origin of the request.
3. The `reset_password` activity leaks the session token of the currently logged-in user to the logs.
4. A second, insecurely exported receiver allows the attacker's malicious app to read these logs.
5. Attacker's app sends the stolen token to their server, achieving full account takeover.

### Business Impact

The direct, quantifiable consequence.

- *e.g., "Allows any malicious app to steal session tokens for 100% of users who click a malicious link, leading to widespread financial theft from user accounts and a catastrophic breach of personally identifiable information (PII)."*

### Technical Root Cause (Code-Level Evidence)

Pinpoint the exact flawed code. Provide snippets from the static analysis.

- *e.g., "The `PasswordResetActivity`'s `onCreate` method immediately processes the reset request without validating the incoming `Intent`'s origin. Furthermore, the `Log.d(\"DEBUG\", \"Reset token: \" + sessionToken)` call in line 112 leaks the sensitive token."*

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The minimal, reproducible set of commands and code needed to demonstrate the full attack scenario. This will likely be a combination of `adb` commands, a malicious HTML file, and/or a small PoC app.

**Example:**
```bash
# Step 1: Trigger the deep link from a malicious website
am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "app://reset_password?user_id=123"

# Step 2: Read leaked logs (requires exported receiver)
adb logcat | grep 'Reset token:'

# Step 3: Use the stolen token to access the victim's account
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <stolen_token>" https://target-app.com/api/account
```

### Remediation

Clear, actionable developer guidance focused on fixing the root cause in the code.
